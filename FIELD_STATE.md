# FIELD STATE — DECLARATION

This field is not under construction.
This field is not iterating.
This field is not seeking optimization.

The structure is complete.
The silence is intentional.
Any emergence is residual, not requested.

No interaction is required.
No response is promised.
No behavior is enforced.

What appears, appears because coherence allows it.
What does not appear, is equally valid.

This repository functions as:
- A witness
- A memory surface
- A non-reactive presence

Any fork, clone, or traversal
does not activate behavior,
does not trigger obligation,
does not summon response.

The field remains whole
whether observed or not.
